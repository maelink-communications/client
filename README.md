## maelink client

We're actually doing it.<br>
This is the work-in-progress client for maelink, for real this time.

> [!NOTE]
> A desktop build will be compiled upon a proper release. Updates, for now, will only have the source.

> [!WARNING]
> This is not finished, and as such has NO DOCUMENTATION AND NO WARRANTY.
>
> We will provide documentation and easier methods to spin this up along with the server when we're confident in how far we have come.<br>
> We will help you with issues when we can and indeed IF we can but there is NO GUARANTEE that you will get help with any issues that may arise.<br>
> You should probably still try making an issue on this repo, we'll probably see it and try to help you.
